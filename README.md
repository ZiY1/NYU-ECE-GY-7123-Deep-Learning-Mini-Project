Modified Residual Network on CIFAR-10, done by Ziyi Huang (zh2931) and Shuning Li (sl10916)

## Overview
The repository contains two ```.ipynb``` files. They are:
- ```ModifiedResNet_CIFAR.ipynb```: The main notebook used to train the network, it will generate a checkpoint file ```ckpt.pth``` as saved model;
- ```CIFAR10_Inference.ipynb```: The notebook used run inference with the saved model on the no_label test set downloaded from Kaggle.
